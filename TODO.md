# To-do List

- [ ] Glen's response
  - [ ] I don't know of a straightforward way to compute the derivative of zeta(s). I did a quick search online and nothing jumped out at me.
  - [ ] For the integral of zeta's modulus on the critical line, |Z(t)|, I would suggest Simpson's rule. |Z(t)| is reasonably well behaved and I think Simpson's Rule would work well, and is fast.
  - [x] Finding the nearest zero of Z(t) to a given value t_0 is not an easy question, but my first thought is to use Newton's method to find a zero t_1, then scan the interval [t_0,t_1] for other zeros.
  - [ ] Improving computational efficiency of the Riemann Siegel algorithm has been studied [for example, see https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=4e9ff7dd91cf62892bab9156d30cf5014c4b48ce], but I don't know of any easy to implement formulas. Theorem 1 in the paper cited gives the new formula, but it seems rather complicated.

- [ ] BH saves last zero passed through for easier sucking

- [ ] I didnâ€™t knew black hole made the game much slower if idled so I lost time.
- [x] Black hole reliance on activeness (gets weaker with offline progress)
  - Idea: black hole no longer lets the particle go through it, but instead will suck the particle to the nearest zero, freezing time
  this will likely resolve tick length issues
- [ ] Change w3 to be x^3 instead of 2^x?

- [x] Drop zeta computation layers from 4 to 1

## Balance

- 0.2.6 (dev)
  - c1 c2 alone can easily reach publication without w2
- 0.2.7 (bependence)
  - Early game too slow
- 0.3.1
  - [x] Move 225 milestone to 250
  - [x] Initial c2 cost from 1400 -> 1500

## Design

- Derivative: currency called delta
  - Synergy: zeta gains radius as t goes up
  - w1: boosts both rho & delta
    - [ ] w1 exponent?
  - w2: boosts delta only

- Black hole ms: when zeta(s) is small t_dot is lower 
  - Current formula: z^2 + 0.02 (small attraction radius)
  - Reduces t gain (and subsequently delta gain) but preserves c1 c2 growth
  - Max speed is the same as no black hole (0.25) to avoid solar swapping
    - [ ] Need tiers?

- [ ] Warp? increases starting t
  - Perma upgrade
  - Power: 2^n

- [ ] Speed ms? used to skip slow early sections
